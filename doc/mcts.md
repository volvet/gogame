# Monte Carlo Tree Search

Monte Carlo Tree Search is a method for finding optimal decisions in a given domain by taking random samples in the decision space and building a search tree according to the result.
A tree is built in an incremental and asymmetric manner. For each iteration of the algorithm, a tree policy is used to find the most urgent node of the current tree. The tree policy attempt to balance considerations of exploration and exploitation.
